# 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations

This repository contains tasks related to Python's variable annotations. The goal of these tasks is to help you understand and practice type annotations in Python, a feature that allows you to explicitly declare the expected types of variables, function arguments, and return values.

## Description

The tasks in this project cover various aspects of Python's type annotations, including basic type annotations, type checking, and using annotations with different data structures such as lists and dictionaries.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Add
- **File**: `0-add.py`
- **Description**: Write a type-annotated function `add` that takes two floats as arguments and returns their sum as a float.

### Task 1: Concat
- **File**: `1-concat.py`
- **Description**: Write a type-annotated function `concat` that takes two strings as arguments and returns their concatenation as a string.

### Task 2: Floor
- **File**: `2-floor.py`
- **Description**: Write a type-annotated function `floor` that takes a float `n` as argument and returns the floor of the float as an integer.

### Task 3: To String
- **File**: `3-to_str.py`
- **Description**: Write a type-annotated function `to_str` that takes a float `n` as argument and returns the string representation of the float.

### Task 4: Define Variables
- **File**: `4-define_variables.py`
- **Description**: Define and annotate variables with specified values and types.

### Task 5: Sum List
- **File**: `5-sum_list.py`
- **Description**: Write a type-annotated function `sum_list` which takes a list of floats and returns their sum as a float.

### Task 6: Sum Mixed List
- **File**: `6-sum_mixed_list.py`
- **Description**: Write a type-annotated function `sum_mixed_list` which takes a list of integers and floats and returns their sum as a float.

### Task 7: To KV
- **File**: `7-to_kv.py`
- **Description**: Write a type-annotated function `to_kv` that takes a string `k` and an integer `v` as arguments and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the string `k`, and the second element is the square of the integer `v` as a float.

### Task 8: Make Multiplier
- **File**: `8-make_multiplier.py`
- **Description**: Write a type-annotated function `make_multiplier` that takes a float `multiplier` as argument and returns a function that multiplies a float by `multiplier`.

### Task 9: Element Length
- **File**: `9-element_length.py`
- **Description**: Write a type-annotated function `element_length` that takes a list of sequences (strings, lists, tuples) and returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a sequence and its length.

### Task 10: Safe First Element
- **File**: `100-safe_first_element.py`
- **Description**: Write a type-annotated function `safe_first_element` that takes a sequence and returns the first element if it exists, otherwise `None`.

### Task 11: Safely Get Value
- **File**: `101-safely_get_value.py`
- **Description**: Write a type-annotated function `safely_get_value` that takes a dictionary and a key, and returns the value associated with the key if it exists, otherwise `None`.

### Task 12: Type Checking
- **File**: `102-type_checking.py`
- **Description**: Write a function `type_checking` that uses `mypy` to check the type annotations of the previous functions.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, simply clone the repository and start exploring the Python files in each task. Each file contains a specific function or set of functions designed to help you practice and understand type annotations in Python.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `mypy` (for task 12)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/0x00-python_variable_annotations.git
